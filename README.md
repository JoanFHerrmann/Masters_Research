The three codes contained within my "Masters_Research" repository are three codes I developed during my masters degree at Oregon State in Python. 
<br>(1) calculate_RMSE.py: developed through National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) IceSAT-2 altimetry satellite to compare satellite derived bathymetric grids with aerial LiDAR derived ones. 
<br>(2) Cross_sections.py: developed through Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) to develop inputs for a physics based erosion model on the Oregon Coast apart of their SPR 843 project to forecast Highway 101 disrupture due to coastal erosion. 
<br>(3) MSS_TSS_final.py: developed through National Oceanic and Atmopsheric Administration (NOAA) VDatum project to assist in vertical datum transformation needs through production of mean sea surface (MSS) and topographic sea surface (TSS) grids. 
Any questions about the code can be sent to herrmanj@oregonstate.edu.
